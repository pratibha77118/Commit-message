# This Markdown includes the implementation of the original circuit on IBM Composer and the Results:

This Circuit included only simple implementation for the process and tested using 0 and 1 only.
but the number can be increased using more states.


## The circuit implementation: (the Transpiled circuit is shown in another Markdown)

## The Probabilities of the Output states: 
 As shown in the Truth Table, we have 4 possible states of 000, 010, 001  and 111 where the one at the far left is our out put.
